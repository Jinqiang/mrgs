/**
 * complete_map_node
 *
 * Summary:
 * This node is responsible for processing a vector containing all the latest maps we've acquired from the local and
 * remote robots.
 * It receives a vector containing all the latest maps, even the repeated ones (so that the vector always contains the
 * latest map from each robot). Then it uses timestamps to determine which parts of the map tree need to be rebuilt, if
 * any.
 *
 * Methodology:
 *  1. Receive maps;
 *  2. Build a tree-like structure for storing and updating merged maps, and another for transforms;
 *  3. Send maps two by two to be aligned as needed. Merged maps and transforms are stored in their respective trees;
 *  4. Calculate and publish the complete_map to map transformations for each robot in the team;
 *  5. Publish the complete map.
 *
