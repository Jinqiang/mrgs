/** 
 * data_interface_node:
 * 
 * Summary:
 * Essentially, this node is charged with all the communication between robots, and with converting between datatypes 
 * used for external and internal communication.
 * This node is responsible for: keeping track of all the topics we must subscribe to in order to communicate with other
 * robots; keeping local copies of foreign maps transforms and poses; propagating those in a standardized way across
 * our local system; transmitting the latest local map, relevant transform and pose across the network.
 * 
 * Methodology:
 * This node maintains a multitude of global variables that, together, represent the current state of the operation, as
 * seen by the local robot.
 * -> g_latest_local_map: The latest map published in /map.
 * -> g_peer_macs: A list of robots we have already encountered.
 * -> g_foreign_map_vector: A vector of foreign maps, for publishing in the local network.
 * -> g_my_comm: WiFiComm object, responsible for facilitating communication.
 * -> g_n: ROS node handle, must be global to make subscription of topics in callbacks possible.
 * -> g_subs: Vector os subscriptions.
 * -> g_publish_map: An external map, for publishing in the network connecting multiple robots.
 * These variables are only written to on very very well determined moments, to prevent race conditions and other data-
 * -related issues.
 * I'm sure that with sufficient time, a few of these could be converted into local variables of some sort. However, in
 * order to complete this project in time, I have opted to combine this approach with programming discipline to ensure
 * there are no issues with using these variables. To any possible future maintaineres, austerity is advised in modify-
 * ing the way these variables interact with the remaining program.
 * 
 * Data Structures:
 * -> ForeignMap: A map received from another robot.
 * -> ForeignMapVector: A vector with a foreign map for each robot we know.
 * -> NetworkMap: The datatype that flows across the network. Contains a compressed map that is decompressed into a 
 * foreign map.
 * -> LatestRobotPose: A Pose including the robot's ID, for transmission into the internal network.
 * -> NetworkPose: The datatype that carries poses on the network. It is simply a pose with the sending robot's MAC
 * address attached.
