/** 
 * remote_nav_node
 * 
 * Summary:
 * This node ensures that TFs and poses are published into the internal network at the correct times.
 * 
 * Methodology:
 * This node is responsible for publishing the following data:
 * -> complete_map to local map (from each robot) TFs;
 * -> local map (from each robot) to local odom TFs;
 * -> remote poses.
 * This information is published repeatedly at (desireably) 10Hz, even if no new info is received, and is meant to
 * facilitate the visualization of the mission's progress. The relatively high rate of transmission is meant
 * to keep the TF tree alive with the latest information gathered in order to ensure the robot is always capable of
 * transforming between its local complete map frame and the frames of every local map, as well as between those maps
 * and the associated poses.
