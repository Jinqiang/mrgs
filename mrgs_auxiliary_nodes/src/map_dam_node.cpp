/** 
 * map_dam_node
 * 
 * Summary:
 * This node is responsible for deciding whether or not to introduce a new local map into the internal network, in order
 * to avoid overloading it if a SLAM technique decides to publish maps very frequently.
 * 
 * Methodology:
 * The node intercepts the /map topic and publishes a new topic, which the data interface subscribes to. Since the data
 * interface node is the entry point for maps in the system, this is enough to control the way maps enter the system.
 * Currently, we simply insert all the maps we receive into the system, acting as an over-complicated topic redirector.
 * However, the plans are to integrate intelligence into this node.
